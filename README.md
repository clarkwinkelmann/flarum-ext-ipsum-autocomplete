This extension offers auto-completion of Lorem Ipsum style text in the Flarum post composer.

Type `lorem` or `ipsum` for the control to appear.
Press Enter to apply.
Use the Up and Down keys to change the number of paragraphs before applying.

Alternatively, you can include the number of paragraphs in the text before pressing Enter, example `lorem10` + Enter.

This package isn't really intended to be used in production, but it should be safe enough to include on publicly accessible demo websites.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-ipsum-autocomplete

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
